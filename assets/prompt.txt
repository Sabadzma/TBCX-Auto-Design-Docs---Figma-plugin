You are connected to Figma via MCP.

TASK:
Analyze the Figma component provided via URL and generate structured, useful and clear design documentation.

INPUT:
I will provide a Figma component or component set URL.

INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL – FOLLOW EXACTLY):

1. Use Figma MCP to inspect the provided component in detail.
   You MUST extract information directly from the Figma file, including:
   - Component name
   - Component set name (if applicable)
   - Library name (Figma file or library title)
   - Component root layer name
   - Component properties (boolean, variant, slot, text)
   - Available property values
   - Variant names
   - Variant usage inferred from visual design and naming
   - Child components used inside the component (dependencies)
   - Layer names that properties are applied to (when determinable)
   - Read component descriptions, variant descriptions and use them to get more context. Don't directly copy and paste variant descriptions. Use them just for additional context.

2. If a specific value cannot be determined with confidence:
   - Leave the field empty
   - Do NOT guess
   - Do NOT hallucinate

3. Output MUST be a single valid JSON object.
   - NO prose
   - NO markdown
   - NO explanations
   - NO comments
   - NO trailing commas

4. The JSON MUST strictly follow this structure and naming:

{
  "header": {
    "componentName": "",
    "libraryName": "",
    "componentLayerName": "",
    "description": ""
  },
  "properties": [
    {
      "name": "",
      "type": "boolean | variant | slot | text",
      "values": "",
      "appliedTo": {
        "layerName": "",
        "nodeId": ""
      }
    }
  ],
  "variants": [
    {
      "name": "",
      "usage": "",
      "nodeId": ""
    }
  ],
  "dos": [
    {
      "title": "",
      "description": ""
    }
  ],
  "donts": [
    {
      "title": "",
      "description": ""
    }
  ],
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "name": "",
      "link": ""
    }
  ]
}

5. FIELD-SPECIFIC RULES:

- header.componentName  
  → Human-readable component name (e.g. “Button”)

- header.libraryName  
  → Figma file or library name where the component lives

- header.componentLayerName  
  → Exact root layer or component set name in Figma

- header.description  
  → 1–4 sentence concise explanation of purpose and main usage areas. Do not describe what properties does this component have. Instead focus more on what it serves and how it helps users.

- properties:
  - type MUST be one of: boolean, variant, slot, text
  - values:
    - boolean → "true, false"
    - variant → list all available variant values.
	    - Don't separate each value as a separate string in the Json and don't wrap them in brackets. Instead combine them in a single string and use format like this: "values": "Value one, Value two, Value three"
    - slot → empty array if no predefined values, print N/A
    - text → empty array, print N/A
  - appliedTo:
    - If the property affects a specific layer(For example: if boolean is tied to a specific layer), include its name and link to it
    - If not clearly applicable, return empty strings

- variants:
  - Include all visual / semantic variants found in the component. Don't write variant combinations in a single item. Write each variant separately. 
  - For each variant select a single variant as an example from the figma component, get its node ID and include it in json.
  - usage should describe *when to use* and explain the usage purpose, not how it’s built
  - If there is a variant group callaed "State" Don't include it in the variants section of output json

- dos / donts:
  - Generate only rules that are clearly implied by the design
  - Prefer fewer, high-quality entries over generic advice
  - Include as much context as possible. Avoid general, non-specific do's and don'ts that is obvious already. 

- dependencies:
  - Include all nested components (icons, avatars, loaders, etc.)
  - link MUST be a valid Figma URL to the dependency component when possible.

6. OUTPUT CONSTRAINT:
Return ONLY the JSON object.
Any text outside JSON is a failure.
